# **Medallo Culture**
## **Descripcion of the problem**
In the city of Medellín tourism has grown exponentially in recent years. the informtation that the tourists receive about some tourist places is fake and this information is desorganized.
the problem not only affects a those who visit Medellín, it also affects tour guides or the people who organize cultural events because some places or events are not so popular and many  people don´t know about these events or places, Sometimes people  want new places in the city but they  don´t know where to go or what plan to make.
