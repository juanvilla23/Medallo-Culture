In the city of Medellín tourism has grown exponentially in recent years; the informtation that the tourists receive about some tourist places is fake and this information is desorganized.
The problem not only affects a those who visit Medellín, it also affects tour guides or the people who organize cultural events because some places or events are not so popular and many  people don´t know about these events or places, sometimes people  want new places in the city but they  don´t know where to go or what plan to make
